# York University Thesis/Dissertation Template

This is a LaTex template for a York University (Toronto, Ontario) Masters Thesis/PhD Dissertation. This is a project created and shared willing, and/or is not endorsed by YorkU and its Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) in any way.

The template follows the technical requirements set by FGS in Summer 2021), to the best of my knowledge and understanding. It builds on Dianne Gall's (<gall@spookyhill.net>) 2011 template available at: https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/york-thesis?lang=en .
